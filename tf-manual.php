							<p> Ohai, and welcome to the other side of CS50! This guide will serve as the official how-to manual for TFs. Among other things, we'll 
							explain in detail how to lead sections so good that none of the dinky science center classrooms will be able to contain your overflowing 
							attendance, stay sane during office hours, and guide student groups to a successful final project. TF-ing CS50 is just as big a time 
							commitment as taking it, so be prepared to reorganize your life a bit! In return, you'll make a ton of friends, desensitize yourself
							to public speaking and performing in front of a camera, and consume inordinate amounts of pizza and candy.

									<p> With a 2012 enrollment of over 700, it's crucial that each student has the opportunity to participate in small group 
									discussions and engage one-on-one with his/her TF. This is accomplished by separating students into small sections led by all
									of you! In terms of content, these sections should be predominantly student-driven, and we leave it to you to determine the
									specific needs of your group. We'll provide you with a large amount of section material organized by week. Come to section prepared
									to teach all of it, but prioritize the content your students clamor for. It's much better to teach a few topics effectively than 
									all of them poorly.</p>  
																	
									Besides teaching, your job as a section leader is to get to know your students, 
									generate enthusiasm for computer science, and allay anxiety. To that end, we will require you to meet individually with each 
									of your students twice over the course of the semester -- once during the first week of sections to get a sense of their background
									and once after Quiz 0 to track their progress. You'll emerge from these meetings with feedback on the effectiveness of your section as well
									as a better awareness of extraordinary effort and personal struggles of individual students, which will be taken into account in the 
									determination of final grades.</p>
